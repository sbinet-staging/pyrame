==================
The motion modules
==================

Pyrame provides a series modules destined to move in a 3D space. In particular, the modules :doc:`motion <cmd_motion>` and :doc:`paths <cmd_paths>` provide an abstraction to interact with different motion controllers and a series of utilities to build motion paths with different constraints, respectively.

Refer to the documentation of each module for more information.
