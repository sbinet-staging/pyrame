In this folder are some specific launcher.
There is no constraint about launching the different parts of Pyrame. 

All the cmd_*.py should be launched with cmdmod as: 
cmdmod /opt/pyrame/cmd_ca_sy527.xml

All the *_server should be launched as binaries as: 
acq_server

All the outputs are done on standard output and can be redirected to files.

The kill_pyrame.sh allows to kill all the pyrame process at the same time
